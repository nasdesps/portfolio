### Description

As the IT Support Specialist for a bustling international college with over 2,500 students and staff, I was at the heart of the campus's technical operations. My role was dynamic and comprehensive, involving end-to-end technical support across a diverse, multi-building campus. I managed the entire user lifecycle, from onboarding new accounts to ensuring smooth system setups across Windows, Linux, and Mac environments. I was the primary point of contact for all technical challenges, resolving Tier 1 and 2 support tickets with a 90% SLA adherence and troubleshooting complex OS issues to minimize downtime for critical academic functions.

Beyond daily support, I was deeply involved in strategic initiatives to improve the IT infrastructure. I took the lead in deploying and configuring a new UVDesk help desk ticketing system on a CentOS server. This project involved not just the technical implementation, but also creating comprehensive documentation for common FAQs and training my coworkers to ensure a smooth adoption.

My passion for efficiency also drove me to embrace automation, utilizing tools like OK Goldy to automate user and email creation within Google Workspace. This initiative not only saved countless hours of manual work but also eliminated errors, standardized processes, and allowed the IT team to focus on more strategic projects like the large-scale campus network overhaul, where I was hands-on in deploying and configuring over 100 switches, access points, and IP cameras.
