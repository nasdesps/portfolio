### Description

As the IT Support Specialist for a bustling international college with over 2,500 students and staff, I was at the heart of the campus's technical operations. My role was dynamic and comprehensive, involving end-to-end technical support across a diverse, multi-building campus. I managed the entire user lifecycle, from onboarding new accounts to ensuring smooth system setups across Windows, Linux, and Mac environments. I was the primary point of contact for all technical challenges, resolving Tier 1 and 2 support tickets with a 90% SLA adherence and troubleshooting complex OS issues to minimize downtime.

My tenure was marked by significant growth and adaptation. I led the complete technical setup of eight new computer labs, managing everything from hardware deployment and network cabling to software installation and configuration. When the COVID-19 pandemic hit, I was instrumental in transitioning the campus to a hybrid learning model, my first professional experience navigating such a large-scale shift. This required rapidly scaling our remote support capabilities and ensuring both students and faculty could operate effectively from anywhere.

A cornerstone project of my time was the complete technical overhaul of the newly acquired Kumari Film Hall. I was deeply involved in the project to transform the old cinema into modern lecture halls, which included designing and deploying the entire network infrastructure, setting up AV systems, and ensuring seamless integration with the main campus network.

To support these expanding operations, I took the lead in deploying a new UVDesk help desk ticketing system on a CentOS server and embraced automation, utilizing tools like OK Goldy to streamline user creation in Google Workspace. These initiatives standardized processes, improved efficiency, and allowed our team to successfully manage the college's ambitious growth.
