### Description

Building on my foundational experience, my internship at BlackBox Technologies immersed me in a more complex, project-based environment. I was an integral part of a development team tasked with building a web-based attendance system from the ground up. This role provided me with invaluable hands-on, full-stack experience. I contributed to the backend by assisting senior engineers with the development of business logic in .NET, giving me insight into server-side architecture. Simultaneously, I was responsible for building responsive, user-facing components for the front-end using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

This experience was a deep dive into the software development lifecycle. I learned how to translate business requirements into technical specifications, participated in code reviews, and understood the synergy between front-end and back-end systems. Working in close collaboration with the engineering team on a single, focused product was an excellent opportunity to apply my skills to a real-world project and solidify my understanding of creating robust, scalable web applications.
