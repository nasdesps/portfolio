### Description

My journey into professional software development began at Radiant Infotech, my first internship and job in the tech industry. This role was a pivotal transition from academic theory to real-world application. I was entrusted with supporting the full lifecycle of client websites, which provided an immersive learning experience. My primary responsibility was to develop responsive, pixel-perfect front-end interfaces using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap, translating design files into functional web components. A key part of this process was using Adobe Photoshop to prepare and optimize web graphics, ensuring both aesthetic quality and optimal performance.

Beyond the initial development, my role extended to managing website content through various CMS platforms and performing rigorous debugging to ensure cross-browser compatibility and a seamless user experience. This foundational internship was crucial in building my confidence and skills in modern web development, teaching me how to collaborate effectively within a team to deliver high-quality digital products for clients.
