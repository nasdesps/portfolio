### Description

My journey at FedEx began as a contractor, where my performance and analytical skills in a fast-paced environment led to my transition to a full-time Associate role. At the device testing center, I was on the front lines of quality assurance for a wide array of consumer electronics. I conducted comprehensive, systematic testing on mobile devices, smartwatches, and routers, executing detailed test plans to identify hardware vulnerabilities, software bugs, and non-compliance with network standards.

My responsibilities included meticulously documenting my findings, reproducing bugs to assist developers, and providing clear, actionable reports to engineering teams. This collaborative process was crucial in accelerating the repair cycle and ensuring that products met the highest standards of quality and security before reaching the market. The role sharpened my analytical skills and gave me a deep appreciation for the importance of rigorous testing in the software development lifecycle.
