### Description

I joined AbbVie initially as a contractor and quickly demonstrated the skills and dedication that led to my conversion to a full-time position. In my role, I stepped into a high-stakes production environment where precision and operational stability are paramount. My work centered on the optimization and maintenance of sophisticated, machine learning-based visual inspection systems. I was responsible for fine-tuning these models, analyzing their performance data, and troubleshooting complex technical issues across both hardware and software, including the POM and PCE systems.

This wasn't just about keeping machines running; it was about enhancing them. By applying a systematic, data-driven approach, I contributed to a 30% reduction in product waste, a metric that translates directly to improved efficiency and sustainability. Working within strict GMPs and utilizing systems like SAP for material tracking, I learned to balance technical problem-solving with rigorous compliance, ensuring that every action contributed to the stability and reliability of mission-critical operations.
