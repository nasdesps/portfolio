## Introduction
Welcome to my personal portfolio website. I respect your privacy and am committed to protecting it. This policy outlines what information is collected when you visit my site and how that information is used.

---

## Information Collection and Use
I collect information in two ways: information you provide directly and anonymous data collected by analytics services.

### Personal Data You Provide
When you request a copy of my resume, you are asked to voluntarily provide your email address.

* **How it's collected:** This information is collected via an embedded Google Form.
* **Why it's collected:** It is used for the sole purpose of sending the requested resume document to you through an automated process managed by Google Apps Script.
* **How it's used:** Your email will not be used for marketing purposes, sold, or shared with any third parties.

### Anonymous Usage Data
To improve the user experience and analyze traffic, this website uses the following third-party services:

* **Umami (Self-Hosted):** This website uses a self-hosted instance of Umami for privacy-focused web analytics. Umami collects anonymous usage data such as page views, referrers, and geographic regions to help me understand website traffic. This service does not use cookies, does not collect any personally identifiable information, and all data is stored on a private server under my control.

* **Cloudflare Web Analytics:** This service collects anonymous traffic data such as page views and country of origin. It does not use cookies or collect personally identifiable information. You can view their privacy policy [here](https://www.cloudflare.com/privacypolicy/).

* **Google Workspace (Forms, Sheets, Apps Script):** Used to manage and automate resume requests.
