## Introduction
Welcome to my personal portfolio website. I respect your privacy and am committed to protecting it. This policy outlines what information is collected when you visit my site and how that information is used.

## Information Collection and Use
I collect information in two ways: information you provide directly and anonymous data collected by analytics services.

### Personal Data You Provide
When you request a copy of my resume, you are asked to voluntarily provide your email address.

* **How it's collected:** This information is collected via an embedded Google Form.
* **Why it's collected:** It is used for the sole purpose of sending the requested resume document to you through an automated process managed by Google Apps Script.
* **How it's used:** Your email will not be used for marketing purposes, sold, or shared with any third parties.

* **Microsoft Clarity:** This service helps me understand user behavior through anonymous session recordings and heatmaps. This data is used to improve the website's design and functionality. You can view their privacy policy [here](https://privacy.microsoft.com/en-us/privacystatement).
