# My First Cloud Ad-Blocker: A Look Back at AdGuard Home on Linode

Hey everyone, Prajwol here.

As I continue to explore different cloud projects, I often think back to the ones that had the biggest impact on my day-to-day life. One of the very first projects that truly changed my internet experience was setting up my own ad-blocking DNS server using AdGuard Home on a Linode instance.

My goal was to find a simple, cost-effective way to block ads and trackers across my entire home network. I wanted a "set it and forget it" solution that would cover every device—from my phone to my smart TV—without needing to install an app on each one. Linode (now Akamai) was the perfect platform for this: straightforward, powerful, and great for hosting a lightweight service like AdGuard Home.

The process of spinning up a small server, running a single installation script, and then seeing the query logs light up with blocked requests was incredibly satisfying. It felt like I had taken back a real measure of control over my own network.

This project remains a fantastic entry point for anyone wanting to get started with self-hosting and network privacy. I've kept the original, detailed guide for anyone who wants to follow along.

It’s a rewarding project that delivers tangible results almost immediately. Let me know if you give it a try!
