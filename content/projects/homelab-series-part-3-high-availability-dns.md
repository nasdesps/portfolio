### Introduction

Welcome to Part 3 of my homelab series! In the previous parts, I built my server and deployed a suite of management and monitoring tools. Now, it's time to build the brain of my network: a robust, redundant, and high-availability DNS system using **AdGuard Home** that works both at home and on the go.

In this detailed guide, I'll walk you through how I deployed a total of **three** AdGuard Home instances, each with its own unique IP address. I set up a primary resolver on my homelab, a secondary failover resolver in the cloud for my mobile devices, and a tertiary resolver on a separate virtual network for local redundancy.

---

### Chapter 1: The Local Workhorse (Primary DNS)

I started by deploying my main, day-to-day DNS resolver on my homelab server.

#### **Step 1: Deploying AdGuard Home with Docker Compose**
First, I SSHed into my server, created a directory for the project, and a `docker-compose.yml` file to define the service.
```bash
mkdir -p ~/docker/adguard-primary
cd ~/docker/adguard-primary
nano docker-compose.yml

```

I pasted in the following configuration. This runs the AdGuard Home container, maps all the necessary ports for DNS and the web UI, and connects it to the shared `npm_default` network I set up in Part 2.

```yaml
services:
  adguardhome:
    image: adguard/adguardhome:latest
    container_name: adguard-primary
    restart: unless-stopped
    ports:
      - "53:53/tcp"
      - "53:53/udp"
      - "8080:80/tcp"      # Web UI
      - "853:853/tcp"      # DNS-over-TLS
    volumes:
      - ./workdir:/opt/adguardhome/work
      - ./confdir:/opt/adguardhome/conf
    networks:
      - npm_default

networks:
  npm_default:
    external: true
```

I then launched the container by running:

```bash
docker compose up -d
```

#### **Step 2: Initial AdGuard Home Setup Wizard**

1. I navigated to `http://<your-server-ip>:3000` in my web browser to start the setup wizard.
    
2. I clicked "Get Started."
    
3. On the "Admin Web Interface" screen, I changed the "Listen Interface" to `All interfaces` and the port to `80`.
    
4. On the "DNS server" screen, I changed the "Listen Interface" to `All interfaces` and left the port as `53`.
    
5. I followed the prompts to create my admin username and password.
    
6. Once the setup was complete, I was redirected to my main dashboard, now available at `http://<your-server-ip>:8080`.
    

#### **Step 3: Configure My Home Router**

To make all my devices use AdGuard automatically, I logged into my home router's admin panel, found the **DHCP Server** settings, and changed the **Primary DNS Server** to my homelab's static IP address (e.g., `192.168.1.10`).

### Chapter 2: The Cloud Failover (Secondary DNS on Oracle Cloud)

An off-site DNS server ensures I have ad-blocking on my mobile devices and acts as a backup.

#### **Why I Chose Oracle Cloud**

After testing the free tiers of both AWS and Linode, I chose **Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)**. In my experience, OCI's "Always Free" tier is far more generous with its resources. It provides powerful Ampere A1 Compute instances with up to 4 CPU cores and 24 GB of RAM, plus 200 GB of storage and significant bandwidth, all for free. This was ideal for running my service 24/7 without the strict limitations or eventual costs associated with other providers.

#### **Step 1: Launching the Oracle Cloud VM**

1. **Sign Up:** I created my account on the Oracle Cloud website.
    
2. **Create VM Instance:** In the OCI console, I navigated to Compute > Instances and clicked "Create instance".
    
3. **Configure Instance:**
    
    - **Name:** I gave it a name like `AdGuard-Cloud`.
        
    - **Image and Shape:** I clicked "Edit". For the image, I selected Ubuntu. For the shape, I selected "Ampere" and chose the `VM.Standard.A1.Flex` shape (it's "Always Free-eligible").
        
    - **Networking:** I used the default VCN and made sure "Assign a public IPv4 address" was checked.
        
    - **SSH Keys:** I added my SSH public key.
        
4. I clicked **Create**. Once the instance was running, I took note of its **Public IP Address**.
    

#### **Step 2: Configuring the Cloud Firewall**

For maximum security, I locked down the administrative ports to only my home IP address.

1. **Find My Public IP:** I went to a site like `whatismyip.com` and copied my home's public IP address.
    
2. **Edit Security List:** I navigated to my instance's details page, clicked the subnet link, then clicked the "Security List" link.
    
3. I clicked "Add Ingress Rules" and added the following rules:
    
    - **For SSH (Port 22):** I set the Source to my home's public IP, followed by `/32` (e.g., `203.0.113.55/32`). This is a critical security step.
        
    - **For AdGuard Setup (Port 3000):** I also set the Source to my home's public IP with `/32`.
        
    - **For AdGuard Web UI (Port 80/443):** I set the Source to my home's public IP with `/32` as well.
        
    - **For Public DNS (Port 53, 853, etc.):** I set the Source to `0.0.0.0/0` (Anywhere) to allow all my devices to connect from any network.
        

#### **Step 3: Installing AdGuard Home & Configuring SSL**

1. **Connect via SSH:** I used the public IP and my SSH key to connect to the VM.
    
2. **Run Install Script:** I chose to install AdGuard Home directly on the OS for this instance.
    
    ```bash
    curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/master/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -v
    ```
    
1. **Get a Hostname:** I went to **No-IP.com**, created a free hostname (e.g., `my-cloud-dns.ddns.net`), and pointed it to my cloud VM's public IP.
    
2. **Enable Encryption:** In my cloud AdGuard's dashboard (**Settings > Encryption settings**), I enabled encryption, entered my No-IP hostname, and used the built-in function to request a Let's Encrypt certificate.
    

#### **Step 4: Creating a Cloud Backup (Snapshot)**

A critical final step for any cloud service is creating a backup. Here is how I did it in OCI:

1. In the OCI Console, I navigated to the details page for my `AdGuard-Cloud` instance.
    
2. Under the "Resources" menu on the left, I clicked on **"Boot volume"**.
    
3. On the Boot Volume details page, under "Resources," I clicked **"Boot volume backups"**.
    
4. I clicked the **"Create boot volume backup"** button.
    
5. I gave the backup a descriptive name (e.g., `AdGuard-Cloud-Backup-YYYY-MM-DD`) and clicked the create button. This creates a full snapshot of my server that I can use to restore it in minutes.

#### **Step 5: ### How to Use Your Cloud DNS on Mobile Devices**

The main benefit of the cloud server is having ad-blocking on the go. Hereâ€™s how I set it up on my mobile phone using secure, encrypted DNS.

##### **For Android (Version 9+):**

Modern Android has a built-in feature called "Private DNS" that uses DNS-over-TLS (DoT), which is perfect for this.

1. Open **Settings** on your Android device.
    
2. Tap on **"Network & internet"** (this may be called "Connections" on some devices).
    
3. Find and tap on **"Private DNS"**. You may need to look under an "Advanced" section.
    
4. Select the option labeled **"Private DNS provider hostname"**.
    
5. In the text box, enter the **No-IP hostname** you created for your Oracle Cloud server (e.g., `my-cloud-dns.ddns.net`).
    
6. Tap **Save**.
    

Your phone will now send all its DNS queries through an encrypted tunnel to your personal AdGuard Home server in the cloud, giving you ad-blocking on both Wi-Fi and cellular data.

##### **For iOS (iPhone/iPad):**

On iOS, the easiest way to set up encrypted DNS is by installing a configuration profile.

1. On your iPhone or iPad, open Safari.
    
2. Go to a DNS profile generator site, like the one provided by AdGuard.
    
3. When prompted, enter the **DNS-over-HTTPS (DoH)** address for your cloud server. It will be your No-IP hostname with `/dns-query` at the end (e.g., `https://my-cloud-dns.ddns.net/dns-query`).
    
4. Download the generated configuration profile.
    
5. Go to your device's **Settings** app. You will see a new **"Profile Downloaded"** item near the top. Tap on it.
    
6. Follow the on-screen prompts to **Install** the profile. You may need to enter your device passcode.
    
Once installed, your iOS device will also route its DNS traffic through your secure cloud server.

### Chapter 3: Ultimate Local Redundancy (Tertiary DNS with Macvlan)

For an extra layer of redundancy _within_ my homelab, I created a third AdGuard instance. By using an advanced Docker network mode called **macvlan**, this container gets its own unique IP address on my home network, making it a truly independent resolver.

1. **Create Macvlan Network:** First, I created the macvlan network, telling it which of my physical network cards to use (`eth0` in my case).
    
    ```bash
    docker network create -d macvlan \
      --subnet=192.168.1.0/24 \
      --gateway=192.168.1.1 \
      -o parent=eth0 homelab_net
    ```
    
2. **Deploy Tertiary Instance:** I created a new folder (`~/docker/adguard-tertiary`) and this `docker-compose.yml`. Notice there are no `ports` since the container gets its own IP.
    
    ```yaml
    services:
      adguardhome2:
        image: adguard/adguardhome:latest
        container_name: adguardhome2
        volumes:
          - "./work:/opt/adguardhome/work"
          - "./conf:/opt/adguardhome/conf"
        networks:
          homelab_net:
            ipv4_address: 192.168.1.11 # The new, unique IP for this container
        restart: unless-stopped
    
    networks:
      homelab_net:
        external: true
    ```
    
3. **Configure Router for Local Failover:** To complete the local redundancy, I went back into my router's DHCP settings.
    
    - In the **Primary DNS** field, I have the IP of my main homelab server (e.g., `192.168.1.10`).
        
    - In the **Secondary DNS** field, I entered the unique IP address I assigned to my macvlan container (e.g., `192.168.1.11`).
        
    
    Now, if my primary AdGuard container has an issue, all devices on my network will automatically fail over to the tertiary instance.

### Chapter 4: Fine-Tuning and Integration

Finally, I implemented some best practices on my primary AdGuard Home instance.

- **Upstream DNS Servers:** Under **Settings > DNS Settings**, I configured AdGuard to send requests to multiple resolvers in parallel for speed and reliability, using **Cloudflare (`1.1.1.1`)**, **Google (`8.8.8.8`)**, and **Quad9 (`9.9.9.9`)**.
    
- **Enable DNSSEC:** In the same settings page, I enabled DNSSEC to verify the integrity of DNS responses.
    
- **DNS Blocklists:** I added several popular lists from the "Filters > DNS blocklists" page, including the **AdGuard DNS filter** and the **OISD Blocklist**, for robust protection.
    
- **DNS Rewrites for Local Services:** This is the key to a clean homelab experience. For each service, I performed a detailed two-step process:
    
    1. **Create the Proxy Host in Nginx Proxy Manager:** I logged into my NPM admin panel, went to **Hosts > Proxy Hosts**, and clicked "Add Proxy Host". For my Homer dashboard, I set the **Forward Hostname** to `homer` (the container name) and the **Forward Port** to `8080` (its internal port), using `homer.local` as the domain name.
        
    2. **Create the DNS Rewrite in AdGuard Home:** I logged into my primary AdGuard dashboard, went to **Filters > DNS Rewrites**, and clicked "Add DNS rewrite". I entered `homer.local` as the domain and the IP address of my Nginx Proxy Manager server as the answer.
        

### Conclusion

I've now built an incredibly robust, multi-layered DNS infrastructure. My home devices use the primary local server, which is backed up by a second, independent local server, and my mobile devices use a completely separate cloud instance for on-the-go protection. This provides a resilient, secure, and ad-free internet experience.

In the final part of this series, we'll shift our focus from deploying services to maintaining them. I'll show you how I set up a fully automated operations pipeline for my homelab, including daily off-site backups, automatic container updates with Watchtower, and proactive alerting with Prometheus. Stay tuned!
