<meta name="description" content="My First Cloud Ad-Blocker: A Look Back at AdGuard Home on Linode
Hey everyone, Prajwol here.
As I continue to explore different cloud projects, I often think back to the ones that had the biggest impact on my day-to-day life. One of the very first projects that truly changed my internet experience was setting up my own ad-blocking DNS server using AdGuard Home on a Linode instance.
My goal was to find a simple, cost-effective way to block ads and trackers across my entire home network. I wanted a &ldquo;set it and forget it&rdquo; solution that would cover every device—from my phone to my smart TV—without needing to install an app on each one. Linode (now Akamai) was the perfect platform for this: straightforward, powerful, and great for hosting a lightweight service like AdGuard Home.">
