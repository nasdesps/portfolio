[{"content":"What\u0026rsquo;s a Docker Container? Before we dive into setting up DeepSeek-R1, let me explain what a Docker container is. Imagine you have a toy that works perfectly on your birthday but gets broken if you move it to another room. A Docker container is like a magic box that keeps your AI model (the toy) in perfect condition wherever you take it, whether it\u0026rsquo;s running as a background task, on a web server, or even in the cloud.\nDocker containers encapsulate everything required to run an application: the code, dependencies, and environment settings. This ensures consistency across different machines, which is super important for AI models that rely on precise configurations.\nSetting Up The Environment Step 1: Install Ubuntu on Windows (If You Haven\u0026rsquo;t Already) If you\u0026rsquo;re using Windows, the easiest way to get an Ubuntu environment is through the Microsoft Store. Here\u0026rsquo;s how:\nOpen the Microsoft Store and search for Ubuntu. Click Get and let it install. Once installed, open Ubuntu from the Start menu and follow the setup instructions. Update the system: sudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt upgrade Now, you have an Ubuntu terminal running on Windows!\nStep 2: Install Docker (If You Haven\u0026rsquo;t Already) First, let\u0026rsquo;s check if you have Docker installed. Open a terminal and run:\ndocker --version If that returns a version number, congrats! If not, install Docker:\nsudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; sudo apt install docker.io -y sudo systemctl enable --now docker Step 3: Prerequisites for NVIDIA GPU Install NVIDIA Container Toolkit:\nConfiguring the production repository: curl -fsSL https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/gpgkey | sudo gpg --dearmor -o /usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg \\ \u0026amp;\u0026amp; curl -s -L https://nvidia.github.io/libnvidia-container/stable/deb/nvidia-container-toolkit.list | \\ sed \u0026#39;s#deb https://#deb [signed-by=/usr/share/keyrings/nvidia-container-toolkit-keyring.gpg] https://#g\u0026#39; | \\ sudo tee /etc/apt/sources.list.d/nvidia-container-toolkit.list Update the package list: sudo apt-get update Install the NVIDIA Container Toolkit: sudo apt-get install -y nvidia-container-toolkit Running Ollama Inside Docker Run these commands(P.S. shoutout to NetworkChuck):\ndocker run -d \\ --gpus all \\ -v ollama:/root/.ollama \\ -p 11434:11434 \\ --security-opt=no-new-privileges \\ --cap-drop=ALL \\ --cap-add=SYS_NICE \\ --memory=8g \\ --memory-swap=8g \\ --cpus=4 \\ --read-only \\ --name ollama \\ ollama/ollama Running DeepSeek-R1 Locally Time to bring DeepSeek-R1 to life locally and containerized:\ndocker exec -it ollama ollama run deepseek-r1 or you can run other versions of deepseek-r1 just by typing in the version at the end after a colon(:)\ndocker exec -it ollama ollama run deepseek-r1:7b After this, play around with the AI, if you wanna exit just type:\n/bye Starting Deepseek-R1 To Start Deepseek-R1 from next time go to Ubuntu and type:\ndocker start ollama this will start ollama docker container; then type:\ndocker exec -it ollama ollama run deepseek-r1:7b ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/running-deepseek-r1-on-docker-container-on-ubuntu/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"whats-a-docker-container\"\u003eWhat\u0026rsquo;s a Docker Container?\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eBefore we dive into setting up DeepSeek-R1, let me explain what a Docker container is.

Imagine AdGuard Home as your personal internet guardian. This versatile tool blocks ads, trackers, and other online nuisances across all devices connected to your network. Whether you\u0026rsquo;re browsing on your phone, tablet, or computer, AdGuard Home has your back.\nIn today\u0026rsquo;s digital landscape, robust security measures are paramount. Protecting each device shields your family from accidental clicks and malicious attacks, ensuring peace of mind and a secure online environment.\nWhy on the Cloud? While setting up AdGuard Home on your home network is great, installing it on a cloud server like Linode takes things up a notch. Here\u0026rsquo;s why:\nOn-the-Go Protection: Your devices stay protected from ads and trackers, no matter where you are, you can even share it with your family. Centralized Control: Manage and customize your ad-blocking settings from a single dashboard. Enhanced Privacy: Keep your browsing data away from prying eyes. Ready to embark on this ad-free adventure? Let\u0026rsquo;s get started!\nSetting Up The Environment Step 1: Create a Linode Cloud Account Why choose Linode? Through NetworkChuck\u0026rsquo;s referral link, you receive a generous $100 cloud credit - a fantastic start!\nSign Up: Navigate to Linode\u0026rsquo;s signup page and register. Access the Dashboard: Log in and select \u0026lsquo;Linodes\u0026rsquo; from the left-side menu. Create a Linode: Click \u0026lsquo;Create Linode,\u0026rsquo; choose your preferred region, and select an operating system (Debian 11 is a solid choice). Choose a Plan: The Shared 1GB Nanode instance is sufficient for AdGuard Home. Label and Secure: Assign a label to your Linode and set a strong root password. Deploy: Click \u0026lsquo;Create Linode\u0026rsquo; and wait for it to initialize. Once your Linode is up and running, access it via the LISH Console or SSH. (use root as localhost login)\nStep 2: Installing AdGuard Home on Linode Yes, we\u0026rsquo;re already into setting up at this point.\nLog In: Access your Linode using SSH or the LISH Console with your root credentials. Update the system: sudo apt update \u0026amp;\u0026amp; apt upgrade -y Go ahead and copy this command to Install Adguard Home: curl -s -S -L https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AdguardTeam/AdGuardHome/master/scripts/install.sh | sh -s -- -v AdGuard Home is installed and running. You can use CTRL+Shift+V to paste into the terminal.\nStep 3: Configure AdGuard Home Post-installation, you\u0026rsquo;ll see a list of IP addresses with port :3000. Access the Web Interface: Open your browser and navigate to the IP address followed by :3000. If you encounter a security warning, proceed by clicking \u0026ldquo;Continue to site.\u0026rdquo; Initial Setup: Click \u0026lsquo;Get Started\u0026rsquo; and follow the prompts. When uncertain, default settings are typically fine. Set Credentials: Set up the Username and Password. Step 4: Integrate AdGuard Home with Your Router After this, your AdGuard Home is running, but in order to use it on your devices you need to set up inside your home router for all your devices to be protected. For that, I can\u0026rsquo;t walk you through each and every router\u0026rsquo;s settings, but the steps are pretty similar.\nFind your router IP address, you should be able to find it on the back of your router (commonly 192.168.0.1 or 192.169.1.1) enter it into your browser. Login into your router using the credentials mentioned in the back of your router; the default is often admin for both username and password. I suggest you change your default password. Configure DNS Settings: Enable DHCP Server: Ensure your router\u0026rsquo;s DHCP server is active. Set DNS Addresses: Input your AdGuard Home server\u0026rsquo;s IP as the primary DNS (mine was 96.126.113.207). For secondary DNS, options like 1.1.1.1 (Cloudflare), 9.9.9.9 (Quad9), or 8.8.8.8 (Google) are reliable. Save and apply the changes. Fine-Tuning AdGuard Home If you\u0026rsquo;ve done everything till here you should be good, but for those who enjoy customizations, AdGuard Home offers a plethora of settings. Some of the customization I did are:\nSettings Go to Settings -\u0026gt; General Settings: You can enable Parental Control and Safe Search. You can also make your Statistics last longer than 24hrs which is default. Now on Settings -\u0026gt; DNS Settings By default, it uses DNS from quad9 which is pretty good but I suggest you add more. You can click on the list of known DNS providers, which you can choose from. I used: https://dns.quad9.net/dns-query https://dns.google/dns-query https://dns.cloudflare.com/dns-query Enable \u0026lsquo;Load Balancing\u0026rsquo; to distribute queries evenly. Scroll down to \u0026lsquo;DNS server configuration\u0026rsquo; and enable DNSSEC for enhanced security. Click on Save. Filters DNS blocklists Go to Filters -\u0026gt; DNS blocklists, here you can add a blocklist that people have created and use it to block even more things. By default, AdGuard uses the AdGuard DNS filter, and you can add more.\nClick on Add blocklist -\u0026gt; Choose from the list Don\u0026rsquo;t choose too many from the list cause it may slow your internet requests. These are the blocklists I added. And just like that you are blocking more and more things. DNS rewrites Go to Filters -\u0026gt; DNS rewrites, here you can add your own DNS entries, so I added AdGuard here.\nClick on Add DNS rewrite Type in domain adguardforme.local and your IP address for AdGuard Home. And save it. Now, when I want to go on the AdGuard Home dashboard I just type in adguardforme.local and I\u0026rsquo;m into AdGuard, I don\u0026rsquo;t have to remember the IP address.\nCustom filtering rules Go to Filters -\u0026gt; Custom filtering rules. For some reason when I use Facebook on mobile device stories and videos did not load up, so I added custom filtering rules.\n@@||graph.facebook.com^$important ","permalink":"http://localhost:1313/blog/adguard-home-on-cloud/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"whats-the-buzz-about-adguard-home\"\u003eWhat\u0026rsquo;s the buzz about AdGuard Home?\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImagine AdGuard Home as your personal internet guardian.
